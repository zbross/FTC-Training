 * First we have to define that this is a TeleOp Opmode by using @TeleOp. The example below is
 * easy to follow. The name and group are not actually necessary, but useful if you want to have
 * multiple modes. If you do not specify a name, you can only have one mode of that type (one TeleOp
 * and one Autonomous). You can include @Disabled to disable a particular OpMode. I have commented
 * it out because I don't want to disable it. This is useful for testing while reducing human error.
